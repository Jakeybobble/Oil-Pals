A turn-based game about messing around with oil, fire and water. Yum.

Notable engine features:
 - NPC brains - NPC's can choose what tiles and characters to target, as well as change behavior depending on context.
 - Abilities - All characters have sets of moves they can use.
 - Terrain combos - Mixing fire and oil creates a big explosion, oh geez.
 - Move memory - You can right click to undo your last action, unless your turn is over.
 - Character effects - It's easy to add effects on characters which affects i.e. damage taken.
 - Tiles - Can change sprite depending on environment and current tile effect (oiled, watered, fired).
 - A funny GUI system - It's a little silly but works, I can't wait for the sequel.
 - NPC's and PC's use the same systems - You can change one line of code to start playing as an enemy!
 - Animation system: It's possible to run variable dependent animation code with the animation system. The fish-man enemy uses this as an example. What a guy.

Most art is made by Byfv, banner and music by Jacob. Yeehaw.
